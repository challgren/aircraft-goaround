Real-time aircraft go-around detection system that monitors TAR1090 feeds to
identify and track aborted landing attempts, providing instant alerts and
comprehensive analysis of these critical safety maneuvers.

## üõ¨ What is a Go-Around?

A go-around (also called aborted landing, missed approach, or wave-off) occurs
when an aircraft on final approach or that has already touched down aborts the
landing and rapidly climbs to circle back for another attempt. Go-arounds occur
in approximately 1-3 per 1000 approaches and are a normal safety procedure.

## üéØ Features

### Go-Around Detection

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously analyzes aircraft altitude and
  vertical rate patterns
- **Multi-factor Detection**: Uses altitude minimums, climb rates, and flight
  path analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns confidence levels (0-1.0) based on detection criteria
- **Severity Classification**: Categorizes events as HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW severity

### Web Interface

- **Live Map View**: Real-time visualization of active go-arounds with flight paths
- **Color-coded Aircraft**: Red for active go-arounds, orange for potential,
  blue for normal
- **Historical Tracking**: Browse and filter all detected go-around events
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Daily detection counts and performance metrics
- **TAR1090 Integration**: Direct links to view events in TAR1090

### Data & Integration

- **CSV Logging**: Automatic logging of all go-around events for analysis
- **Real-time Statistics**: Track daily detections and event severity
- **Multi-source Support**: Works with any TAR1090-compatible data source
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment with multi-architecture container support

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=aircraft-goaround \
  -p 8889:8889 \
  -e TAR1090_URL=http://your-tar1090:80 \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/challgren/aircraft-goaround:latest
```

### With Public TAR1090 URL

If your TAR1090 instance is accessible at a different URL for users (e.g.,
through a reverse proxy):

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=aircraft-goaround \
  -p 8889:8889 \
  -e TAR1090_URL=http://tar1090:80 \
  -e PUBLIC_TAR1090_URL=https://radar.example.com/map \
  -v ./data:/app/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/challgren/aircraft-goaround:latest
```

### Using Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:

## üè• Health Monitoring

### Docker Health Check

The container includes comprehensive health checks that monitor:

- Python process status
- Web server responsiveness
- API endpoint availability
- TAR1090 connection status
- CSV file writability

Health check configuration:

- **Start Period**: 40 seconds
- **Check Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds per check
- **Retries**: 3 failures before marking unhealthy

### Health API Endpoint

Access health status at: `http://localhost:8889/api/health`

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "running": true,
  "server_url": "http://tar1090:80",
  "total_aircraft": 142,
  "active_go_arounds": 2,
  "potential_go_arounds": 5,
  "detected_today": 8,
  "last_update": "2024-01-15T10:30:45"
}
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Web Interface

### Reverse Proxy Support

The application works seamlessly behind reverse proxies including when mounted
at a subpath.

#### Nginx Configuration Example

For mounting at `/goaround/`:

```nginx
location /goaround/ {
    proxy_pass http://aircraft-goaround:8889/;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Prefix /goaround;
    proxy_redirect / /goaround/;
}
```

## üìä Detection Algorithm

The system detects go-arounds by analyzing:

1. **Low Altitude**: Aircraft below 2000 ft (configurable threshold)
2. **Rapid Climb Rate**: Vertical rate exceeding 1000-1500 ft/min
3. **Altitude Recovery**: Significant altitude gain from recent minimum
4. **Descent-to-Climb Transition**: Rapid change from descending to climbing

### Severity Classification

- **HIGH**: Min altitude < 500 ft and climb rate > 2000 ft/min
- **MEDIUM**: Min altitude < 1000 ft and climb rate > 1500 ft/min  
- **LOW**: All other detected go-arounds

## üíæ Data Storage

Go-around events are logged to CSV with the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | Detection time (ISO format) |
| `hex_id` | Aircraft ICAO hex identifier |
| `callsign` | Flight callsign |
| `lat`, `lon` | Geographic coordinates |
| `min_altitude` | Lowest altitude during approach (ft) |
| `max_climb_rate` | Maximum climb rate (ft/min) |
| `duration` | Duration of maneuver (seconds) |
| `confidence` | Detection confidence (0.0-1.0) |
| `tar1090_url` | Link to TAR1090 replay |

## üìö Common Go-Around Reasons

Based on aviation statistics, go-arounds occur for these reasons:

### Weather (Most Common)

- Strong winds or wind shear
- Poor visibility (fog, heavy rain)
- Thunderstorms or microbursts

### Runway Issues

- Runway occupied by another aircraft
- Animals or debris on runway
- Slow-to-clear traffic

### Unstabilized Approach

- Too high or too fast on approach
- Incorrect aircraft configuration
- ATC spacing requirements

### Technical Issues

- Landing gear problems
- System warnings or alerts
- Bird strikes

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### No Aircraft Showing

- Verify TAR1090 URL is correct and accessible
- Check that `/data/aircraft.json` endpoint returns data
- Ensure TAR1090 is receiving ADS-B data

```bash
# Test TAR1090 connection
curl http://your-tar1090:80/data/aircraft.json
```

### No Go-Arounds Detected

- Go-arounds are relatively rare events (1-3 per 1000 approaches)
- Monitor areas near busy airports for higher detection rates
- Verify aircraft have altitude and vertical rate data available

### Connection Issues

```bash
# Test with the application
python3 go_around_tracker.py --server http://your-tar1090:80 --test

# Check Docker logs
docker logs aircraft-goaround
```

### Docker Health Check Failed

```bash
# Check container health
docker inspect aircraft-goaround --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'

# View health check logs
docker inspect aircraft-goaround --format='{{range .State.Health.Log}}{{.Output}}{{end}}'
```
